## Description

Someone in my house seems to be doing something fishy again… Maybe this time I will investigate. I’ve tapped into the connection of said person’s internet, perhaps you could help me find what they’re doing?

The (compiled) code and docker files required to run the set up locally are provided.

## Hints

- The debugger is your good friend

## Tags

web, wireshark, websocket, cryptography, rsa, reverse engineering

## Pcap?

The pcap file is manually crafted by actually doing it in a VM, lmao
